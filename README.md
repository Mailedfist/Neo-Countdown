# Neo-Countdown
So to keep my stoked level in check for my freshly booked summer holiday I decided to make a timer to countdown to the day of departure.
Hardware is likely to be an Adafruit Trinket 3.3V for low power consumption.

In this repo I'm going to try and build arduino code,
this code will run a 256 day countdown, 
changing the colour of a neopixel in a strip of 8 neopixels
